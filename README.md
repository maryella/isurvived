### An app to help people manage medications after a heart attack

### The Premise
Heart disease is the leading cause of death among Americans. Luckily, there is fairly good evidence showing certain can help people who have had heart attacks live longer, healthier lives. However, there are four main types of drugs recommended for most people after a heart attack. It's easy to see why people may feel overwhelmed by all these new medications. Addtionally, our health care providers may not have time to explain each medication and why it's important. 

This app is designed to help walk people through their new medications. It provides information about each drug class, including why it's important after a heart attack, then has the user input the drug and dose information for their particular drug in the class. If the user is not taking one of these medications, they can ask their prescriber why not and make a note of why they are not taking such an important drug.

### The Tech
This app is built using an ExpressJS, React, and Postgres. The Express server works in part as an API, with some routes protected by a JSON web token. The client side is built with React, with an emphasis on pure functional components.
