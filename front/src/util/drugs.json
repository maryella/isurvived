Studies have shown that people who take this type of drug can see more improvement in their heart's ability to pump blood to the body. </p></li><li><h4>May help you live longer</h4><p>Studies have shown that people who take this type of drug are less likely to die in the months and years following their heart attack.</p></li><li><h4>May prevent heart failure from worsening</h4><p>Heart attacks damage your heart, which can lead to heart failure. People who take this drug are less likely to see their heart failure get worse.</li></ul><h3 class=\"font-weight-bold\">Side effects and why you might not take it</h3><ul><li><h4>Low Blood Pressure</h4><p>Sometimes these drugs can lower your blood pressure too much.</p></li><li><h4>High Potassium</h4><p>These drugs sometimes cause the potassium in your body to become too high. Your health care provider should check your potassium levels before and a few weeks after starting this type of drug.</p></li><li><h4>Pregnancy</h4><p>These drugs can harm unborn children. Tell your health care team and stop taking this type of drug if you become pregnant.</p></li><li><h4>Kidney Function</h4><p>Rarely, this type of drug can affect your kidneys. This is something else your prescriber should check when your potassium is checked. </p></li> </ul><h3 class=\"font-weight-bold\">Other things to keep in mind</h3><p>ACE Inhibitors (drugs that end in 'pril') can sometimes have other side effects, such as</p><ul><li><h4>Angioedema</h4><p>This is a severe swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat. If this happens to you, contact your prescriber immediately and don't take this medication</p></li><li><h4>Dry cough</h4><p>Sometimes these drugs can cause a longlasting dry cough. If this happens to you, contact your prescriber but do not stop the medication unless they tell you too. They will likely want to see you since a cough like this can be caused by many things.</p></li></ul>",

Rarely, they can also damage the muscle. Tell your doctor if your muscles are sore when you wouldn't expect them to be. Sometimes, even more rarely, the muscle damage can be severe. If you have a hard time moving your arms and legs or you notice your urine is dark brown or red (like cola), don't take any more of the medication and contact your provider immediately.</p></li></ul><h3 class=\"font-weight-bold\">Other things to keep in mind</h3><ul><li><h4>Grapefruit</h4><p>Some members of the statin famiy can interact with grapefruit and its juice.
